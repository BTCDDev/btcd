For Ubuntu: make sure to have clang and curl installed, everything else is included in this repo

git clone https://github.com/jl777/btcd
cd btcd/libjl777
make onetime
./m_unix

Make sure to have SuperNET.conf in the libjl777 directory. Also, note that SuperNET is a different process
from BitcoinDarkd and has to be manually killed each time you run. This will be fixed soon

For Windows: coming soon

For Macintosh: you can build SuperNET using the same process as for unix, building the wallet with Mac should be
the same as the baseline BitcoinDarkd, but has not been verified yet
